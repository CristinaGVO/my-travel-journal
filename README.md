 🌍 My-Travel-Journal

My Travel Journal is a full-stack MEN application that allows users to create a personal travel diary.  
After signing up, users can record, view, update, and delete their trips — storing memories such as destination, location, trip type, dates, notes, photos links, and ratings.

This project was created as part of General Assembly’s Software Engineering Immersive (Project 2).

✨ Features (MVP)

- User authentication (sign up, sign in, session-based auth)
- Authorization (only logged-in users can manage their trips)
- CRUD functionality for trips:
  - Create a new trip
  - View all trips (Index)
  - View trip details (Show)
  - Edit a trip
  - Delete a trip
- Embedded Trip schema inside the User model using Mongoose
- EJS templates for views
- RESTful routing structure

Stretch Goals (Planned)

- Filter trips by type (roadtrip, hiking, city, beach, etc.)
- Filter or sort trips by rating
- Upload multiple photos using external services (Cloudinary, etc.)

 Technologies Used
 
- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- MongoDB + Mongoose  
- EJS  
- CSS / Flexbox / Grid  
- Session-based authentication  
- Git & GitHub
